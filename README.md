# CHAPTER 3: MEMORY PUZZLE

## How to Play Memory Puzzle

In the Memory Puzzle game, several icons are covered up by white boxes. There are two of each
icon. The player can click on two boxes to see what icon is behind them. If the icons match, then
those boxes remain uncovered. The player wins when all the boxes on the board are uncovered.
To give the player a hint, the boxes are quickly uncovered once at the beginning of the game.

## Source Code of Memory Puzzle

This source code can be downloaded from http://invpy.com/memorypuzzle.py.
Go ahead and first type in the entire program into IDLE’s file editor, save it as memorypuzzle.py,
and run it. If you get any error messages, look at the line number that is mentioned in the error 
message and check your code for any typos. You can also copy and paste your code into the web
form at http://invpy.com/diff/memorypuzzle to see if the differences between your code and the
code in the book.

You’ll probably pick up a few ideas about how the program works just by typing it in once. And
when you’re done typing it in, you can then play the game for yourself.
